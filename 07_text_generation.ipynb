    "Text generation is one of the most exciting applications of modern NLP. From creative writing to code generation, chatbots to content creation, generative models are transforming how we interact with AI.\n",

    "## What is Text Generation?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text Generation** produces human-like text:\n",
    "- **Input**: Prompt or seed text\n",
    "- **Output**: Coherent continuation or completion\n",
    "- **Examples**: Story writing, code completion, dialogue systems\n",

    "By the end of this notebook, you'll know how to:\n",
    "1. Use different generation strategies (greedy, beam search, sampling)\n",
    "2. Control generation with parameters (temperature, top-k, top-p)\n",
    "3. Fine-tune models for specific generation tasks\n",
    "4. Handle different types of generation (completion, chat, code)\n",
    "5. Evaluate generated text quality\n",
    "6. Build practical generation applications\n",
