# learn-huggingface ü§ó

A collection of Jupyter notebooks for learning Hugging Face Transformers, covering everything from basic model usage to advanced fine-tuning techniques.

## üìö What You'll Learn

This repository provides hands-on experience with:

- **Model Loading & Usage**: Loading pre-trained models and tokenizers
- **Text Classification**: Sentiment analysis, topic classification, and custom text classification
- **Token Classification**: Named Entit
y Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech tagging
- **Text Generation**: GPT-style text generation and controlled generation
- **Question Answering**: Extractive and generative QA systems
- **Fine-tuning**: Custom model training on your own datasets
- **Model Optimization**: Quantization, pruning, and deployment techniques
- **Multi-modal Models**: Working with vision-language models
